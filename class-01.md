# How Pages Use Structure

the structure us very similar when a news story is viewed online 
this is illustrated on the right with a copy if the newspaper 
alongside the corresponsdeng artickle on it's website.

the use of **heading** and **subheading** in any document often reflect
a hiierarchy of information

### HTM L Us es El ements to Describe the Structure of Pages

*Let's look closer at the code from the last page. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.*

**A Closer Look at Tags**
## < P >
which contain the openning tag and the name of the element and the cloing tag



## Body, Head & Title

**<body>**
You met the <body> element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.

**<head>**
Before the <body> element you
will often see a <head> element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.

**<title>**
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time).

### DOCTYPES


Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the book.

### Comments in HTML :
> `<!-- -->`

### id attributE

Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).
	
# HTML5 Layout:

The new *HTML5* elements indicate the purpose of  X different parts of a web page and help to describe      its structure.

The new elements provide clearer code (compared  X with using multiple <div> elements).

Older browsers that do not understand HTML5  X elements need to be told which elements are        block-level elements.

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8  X (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# Process & Design:

## WireFrames:

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require

## visual hierarchy

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for


## grouPing anD similarity

When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved
