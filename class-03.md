# Boxes :

## Boxes Dimensions :

### width and hight :
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size

### Limiting Width :

* min-width & Max-width :

Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

hese are very helpful properties to ensure that the content of pages are legible (especially on the smaller screens of handheld devices). For example, you can use the max-width property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too wide within a big browser window and you can use the min-width property to make sure that they do not appear too narrow.


* Limiting Heighty  :
min-height and nmax height :

In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties

* Ovederflowing Content :
Overflow
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:

- hidden :

This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.

- scroll :

This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

## Border,Margin and Padding :

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance

The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.

The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values

* `thin` 
* `medium`
* `thick`

## Switch Statement:

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

## loops :

the loops check a condition if it is true
a block of code runs then it check again 
and while the condition still true the code will repeat again and again :
