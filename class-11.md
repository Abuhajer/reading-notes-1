# Images
Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 
Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

## background-image :
The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
## background-repeat :
 * `repeat` : The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
 * `repeat-x` : The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
